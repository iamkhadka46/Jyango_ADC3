I — Interface segregation principle
This principle is fairly easy to comprehend.
In fact, if you’re used to using interfaces, chances are that you’re already applying this principle.
If not, it’s time to start doing it!
In programming, the interface segregation principle states that no client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.
Put more simply: Do not add additional functionality to an existing interface by adding new methods.
Instead, create a new interface and let your class implement multiple interfaces if needed.
