About Git
git init will create a new local GIT repository. The following Git command will create a repository in the current directory:
git init
Alternatively, you can create a repository within a new directory by specifying the project name:

git init [project name]
git clone is used to copy a repository. If the repository lies on a remote server, use:
git clone username@host:/path/to/repository
Conversely, run the following basic Git command to copy a local repository:

git clone /path/to/repository
git add is used to add files to the staging area. For example, the basic Git following command will index the temp.txt file:
git add <temp.txt>
git commit will create a snapshot of the changes and save it to the git directory.
git commit –m “Message to go with the commit here”
Note that any committed changes won’t make their way to the remote repository.

git config can be used to set user-specific configuration values like email, username, file format, and so on. To illustrate, the command for setting up an email will look like this:
git config --global user.email youremail@example.com
The –global flag tells GIT that you’re going to use that email for all local repositories. If you want to use different emails for different repositories, use the command below:

git config --local user.email youremail@example.com
git status displays the list of changed files together with the files that are yet to be staged or committed.

git push is used to send local commits to the master branch of the remote repository. Here’s the basic code structure:
git push origin <master>
